This is a small set of tests that exercise the client C and the proxy P.

It requires:
 * C and P connected together and running:

   `bin/c`

   `bin/p`

 * Access to the media/ folder

Once things are set up, run the tests with:

  `make`

See how the tests are written and write more tests that exercise things further.

We're particularly interested in tests that cover more and more rainy-day scenarios.
